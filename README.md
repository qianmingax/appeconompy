# appeconompy
Applied econometrics with Python

## Vision
Python is an elegant computer language and it has a lot of packages which can be used in data analysis. These packages contain scipy, numpy, pandas, statsmodels and so on, all these make data analysis convenient, but these packages only provide basic functions. When using them for data management and analysis in a discipline, we have to write many codes for handling data and constructing model in the discipline. STATA is predominant in applied econometrics because it's command are very easy and concise. I want there is a package can be used for econometrics analysis like stata, so I build this package, appeconompy, which is a wrapper of data-management and model-building functions for econometrics.
